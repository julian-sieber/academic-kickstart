abstract: "We prove an enhanced limit theorem for additive functionals of a multidimensional Volterra process $(y_t)_ {t\\geq 0}$. As an application, we establish weak convergence of the solutions of  rough differential equations (RDE) of the form
$$
  dx^\\varepsilon_t=\\frac 1  {\\sqrt \\varepsilon}  f(x_t^\\varepsilon,y_{\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon}})\\,dt+g(x_t^\\varepsilon)\\,d\\mathbf{B}_t,$$
and identify their limits as solutions of an RDE driven by a Gaussian field with  a drift coming from the Lévy area correction of the limiting rough driver. The equation models a passive tracer in a random field.

In particular if $h$ is random field such that $h(x, \\cdot)$ a semi-martingale with spatial parameter $x$, we show that the solutions of the equations 
$$  dx^\\varepsilon_t=\\frac 1  {\\sqrt \\varepsilon}  f(x_t^\\varepsilon,y_{\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon}})\\,dt+h(x_t^\\varepsilon, dt),$$
 converge weakly to that of 
a Kunita type  Itô SDE $dx_t=G(x_t,dt)$ where $G(x,t)$ is a semi-martingale with spatial parameters. Furthermore the $N$-point motions converge."
