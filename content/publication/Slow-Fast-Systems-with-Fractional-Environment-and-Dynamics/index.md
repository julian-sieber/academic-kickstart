abstract: "We prove an averaging principle for interacting slow-fast systems driven by independent fractional Brownian motions. The mode of convergence is in HÃ¶lder norm in probability. We also establish geometric ergodicity for a class of fractional-driven stochastic differential equations, partially improving a recent result of Panloup and Richard."
